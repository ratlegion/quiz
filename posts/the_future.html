            <h1>The Past n' Future of RatLegion.com</h1>
            <p>
                I first came up with the idea of this very website a bit over 2 years ago sort of loosely based around a
                in-joke I had with a friend group. The website was a very basic page that could've been made in the 90s
                with links to other pages mostly filled with images. At that time I was a total noob to html, css. So I
                mostly just used ChatGPT(which had launched a couple months prior), to write it. Over time I eventually
                built my skills till I no longer needed it and could rely on documentation instead. That website now
                only exists on my hard drive, and it will stay that way. But its idea lived on.
                <br><br>
                Much later I wanted to make a rat themed game(don't question), I started to get into the <a
                    href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot game engine</a>, and I built a simple platformer game with a
                rat as the protagonist. I wanted a domain to host that game on so I looked around and thought
                "ratlegion.com" sounded interesting, so I bought it. (Although in hindsight I now probably would've
                prefered ratlegion.net or ratlegion.land instead.) I didn't do much with it, and later I gave up working
                on the game. But I imagined what I could've done.
                <br><br>
                Then, I was researching for a free online personality quiz maker, however I noticed that every single
                one saved the result in the cloud, which usually meant it was not free. I however thought I could try
                and make my own that saves all data in the url itself (such as <a href="beepbox.co">BeepBox</a>). I got
                to work coding, it is the most complicated thing I've made, and it took a full month before it even
                worked. <a href="../quiz/editor.html">But it does!</a> I needed a website to host it on of course. And
                no website is complete without a nice domain. Hey wait! I have a nice domain! So I put it on my GitHub,
                and after lots of struggling, got my domain to work. This was also a perfect excuse to finally give
                ratlegion a homepage as it had deserved so long ago.
                <br><br>
                And that's where we are right now. Based on this trajectory so far, I don't think ratlegion is going end
                up how I want it too unless I make a change. So what do I want to do with this site? Well, in essence I
                want to turn it into a modernized version of a flash game site (featuring a rat theme). As of now this
                website is just a personal website/project dump and I need to make some major redesigns to accommodate
                both the quiz maker part as well as all the fun stuff I want to add. Once I do, maybe I'll even finish
                that rat platformer game that started this.
